        <p>Wicked crispy fried chicken</p>
        <p>No need for a whole backstory on why I love fried chicken. Let's get into this beast.</p>

        <p>Ingredients: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (3-4 pound|1 kilogram 360 gram) chickens, broken down into 10 pieces each (breasts are cut into 2 pieces), backbone discarded</li>
            <li> cups|1 liter 183 ml strained pickle juice</li>
            <li>4 cups|946 ml buttermilk</li>
            <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup cayenne</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground mace</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon poultry seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sweet paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon whole fennel seed</li>
            <li>¼ cup kosher salt, plus more</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>16 cups|3 liters 785 ml canola oil</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bucket or pot, submerge the chicken pieces in the pickle juice. Refrigerate for 24 hours or up to 3 days.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken pieces from the pickle brine and submerge it in the buttermilk. Refrigerate for another 4 hours or up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour with the spices. Generously season chicken all over with salt and pepper. Dredge chicken pieces in flour, shaking off excess.</li>
            <li>Heat 4-inches of oil in a large saucepan over medium until a deep-fry thermometer reads 325°F|160°C.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry the chicken, turning occasionally, until it is cooked through and dark brown, 15 minutes for white meat, 20 minutes for dark meat. Drain on a cooling rack fitted over a baking sheet, sprinkle with salt, and let cool for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with hot sauce, lemon wedges, and the bread.</li>
        </ol>
